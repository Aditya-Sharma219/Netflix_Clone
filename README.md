# Netflix UI Clone

This is a **Netflix UI Clone** created using **HTML, CSS**. The project is a replica of the **Netflix** website interface, designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development. It includes the core structure and design elements of the Netflix homepage, focusing on layout, styling, and responsiveness.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Header Section**: Includes the Netflix logo, navigation links, and a sign-in button.
- **Hero Section**: Features the main promotional banner with a call-to-action for users to sign up.
- **Movie & Show Categories**: Displays different sections showcasing popular movies and TV shows in a video format.
- **Footer Section**: Includes links to various Netflix services, customer support, and social media.

This project highlights my ability to create pixel-perfect UI clones while ensuring responsiveness and smooth user experience.
